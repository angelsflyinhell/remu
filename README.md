![Tests](https://github.com/angelsflyinhell/remu/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)
A simple NES emulator implemented in Rust.

Status: Work in progress.

## About
This emulator is mainly meant to be more of a learning experience rather than a program made for public use. Though by the end of this project, it should be able to emulate the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) decent enough to play games on it.

## Contributing
A guide on how to contribute will follow soon.

## Credit
This project is heavily based on the [NES E-Book](https://bugzmanov.github.io/nes_ebook) by bugzmanov.
